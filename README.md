# HangMan
This is a fun little hangman game that I programmed with the help of the self.py course by Campus IL for basic python programming.    
I took this course before going to university so this was actualy my first proramming project!    
## How to play
When you run the game you first need to enter a path to a file filled with words that are seperated by spaces, later you would have to guess one of these words.  
Then you will have 6 failed attemps that you can have before you lose.  
Each turn you will guess one english letter, if the letter is in the word it will be put in all the places that it apears in the word, but if the letter is not in the word then one more line would be added to the hanged man drawing.  
Do your best to not get the man hanged! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
